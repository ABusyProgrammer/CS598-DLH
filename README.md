## Notes
1. See the formal report here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bmM1wJxqJMKpM7Ebie5b2C6LmB0BAMuZ#scrollTo=vo-VAhKtwMuV
2. The code here is an alternate way of running my implementation (still in draft phase). A lot of the code is currently re-used from the paper's code itself, however, re-writes have taken place to optimize it where possible.
3. The dataset used is `host/patients.csv` from the MIMIC-IV dataset. Since I am still pending on access (I am supposed to get it by the end of the coming week), I am relying on the free subset provided on [this site](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo/2.2/hosp/#files-panel), under `patients.csv.gz` (which I extracted using 7Zip on Windows 11).
4. I unfortunately was not able to get the code in a fully operational state, due to the data and and some issues with getting the `pip install` dependencies to work. Most issues have been sorted, and should be cleared in time for the final submission.
