## Draft Rough Submission
1. [DL4H_Team_27.ipynb](https://github.com/ABusyProgrammer/CS598-DLH/blob/main/DLH4_Team_27.ipynb) contains the Jupyter Google Collab notebook with my draft.
2. [dl4h_team_27.py](https://github.com/ABusyProgrammer/CS598-DLH/blob/main/dl4h_team_27.py) contains the Python pure-code verson of the above notebook. Same thing.

## Notes
1. See the formal report here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14ucq_3wQ5zHUL9b5SyU_06gfa1724bnd . The entire reproduced code, findings, results and discussions can be found there. This is the exact same report as the Jupyter notebook in this GitHub repo.
  1. Note that you will not be able to run this project on Google Collab unless you upgrade to a more powerful instance; I used AWS SageMaker notebook to run this. The Google Collab is just shared as a formality, but it won't work (expect an out-of-memory error at training stage).
3. The code here is an alternate way of running my implementation. A lot of the code is currently re-used from the paper's code itself, however, re-writes have taken place to optimize it where possible.
4. The dataset is directly imported as a Python package; therefore, it does not need to be uploaded here.
5. The video is linked above too for convenience.
