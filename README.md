## Draft Rough Submission
1. [DL4H_Team_27.ipynb](https://github.com/ABusyProgrammer/CS598-DLH/blob/main/DLH4_Team_27.ipynb) contains the Jupyter Google Collab notebook with my draft.
2. [dl4h_team_27.py](https://github.com/ABusyProgrammer/CS598-DLH/blob/main/dl4h_team_27.py) contains the Python pure-code verson of the above notebook. Same thing.

## Notes
1. See the formal report here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bmM1wJxqJMKpM7Ebie5b2C6LmB0BAMuZ#scrollTo=vo-VAhKtwMuV . The entire reproduced code, findings, results and discussions can be found there.
2. The code here is an alternate way of running my implementation. A lot of the code is currently re-used from the paper's code itself, however, re-writes have taken place to optimize it where possible.
3. The dataset is directly imported as a Python package; therefore, it does not need to be uploaded here.
4. The video is linked above too for convenience.
